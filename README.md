# Session: Unlock Dynamics365 with Azure Integrating Services

Microsoft offers Dynamics as a line of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software applications. It is available for different verticals such as manufacturing, retail, and financial services.

In recent years, many organizations have moved to the cloud with their applications and data or will move in the wake of COVID-19. Moreover, organizations that have moved to the cloud are now discovering that as you adopt more cloud technology, the need for integration between those systems increases. This also applies to organizations that leverage D365 and need to communicate to other systems to support their business processes.

Unlocking D365 in the cloud to enable communication with various other systems requires services available in Azure like Logic Apps and Functions. Furthermore, other aspects like volume, frequency, governance, security, and deployments should be considered as well.

Thus, in this session, the speaker will share his experience unlocking D365 leveraging Azure Integration Services to exchange data with other systems. In addition, he will share pitfalls and lessons learned.
